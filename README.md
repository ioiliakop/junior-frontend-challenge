## Notes
This project supports responsive layout according to the challenge's requirements<br/>
However, it hasn't been tested on a tablet, as I didn't have one at my disposal<br/>
The Medium viewport (md) of bootstrap was assumed that would be used in tablet view<br/>
Large (lg) and Extra Large (xl) viewports were configured for desktop view<br/>
Extra Small (xs) and Small (sm) viewports were configured for mobile view<br/>

This app has been deployed on surge<br/>
